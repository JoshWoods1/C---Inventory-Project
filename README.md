# Overview

This is a beginner C++ project that I made to get an understanding of the language and what it can do. I know that C++ has much more power than what I used it for in this project, but it was fun getting to know the basics.

I made an inventory manager that allows a user to enter, delete, display, and search for items. 

I wrote this project to get familiar with C++ and what it can do. There is a lot of things that I can stand to learn about it but it was fun to get experience with the language.

# Development Environment

-VS Code
- MinGW Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC)

Using C++ was a little different for me but reminded me of C# a little bit, mainly because I used classes in my program. The syntax has unique differences that I haven't seen before but overall was fairly simple to know the basic syntax.

# Future Work
- I plan on adding the UpdateQuantity method within the program so that it will be functional.
- I will also implement a method so that when the user wants to exit the program, they actually will be able to.
